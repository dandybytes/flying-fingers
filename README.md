# FLYING FINGERS

Flying Fingers is a typing performance assessment app created with [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). It uses pure stateless functional components with React hooks and context. The app collects ample input data and computes detailed performance metrics, which are presented to the user at the end of the test.
